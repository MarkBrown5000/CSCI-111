{
//   Outlab 1: Writing Your Own Class
// 
// Due: Monday 08 September at 8 am
// Purpose
// 
// Create a simple Class on your own
// Partners
// 
// This is an individual assignment, though collaboration (not solution sharing) is allowed.
// 
// Problem Statement
// 
// You have been contracted by a local grocery store to develop a software system to hold information about items in the store. You will create a new class called GroceryItem that will be able to represent different items for sale in the store. These items have a name, cost and aisle number it is located at in the store. You will also need to make a "get method" for each instance variable as well a constructor that takes the name, cost, and aisle number as parameters. Finally, there must also be a method that allows the user to change the cost of an item.
// 
// Assignment
// 
// Create a BlueJ project called Outlab1, add a class called Driver and paste this code into it. Driver should not be modified.
// Create a new class called GroceryItem (spelling and capitalization important).
// Within GroceryItem, declare an instance variable called name that can contain a value such as "Eggs", an instance variable called cost that can contain a value such as "1.21", and an instance variable called aisleNum that can contain a value such as "5" (but not "5.2").
// Create a constructor that takes the following parameters (in order):
// The item's name
// The item's cost
// The aisle number where the item is located
// Create the method: getName() that returns the name of the item.
// Create the method: getCost() that returns the cost of the item.
// Create the method: getAisle() that returns the aisle number it is located in.
// Create the method: changeCost(parameter) where "parameter" is the dataType and variable name of the new cost for that item. Nothing is returned and the cost is updated.
// Output
// 
// If GroceryItem has been implemented correctly, this output will be produced when the main method of Driver is run (right click Driver, select "void main(String[] args)", select "Ok").
// Hints
// 
// Completing this assignment requires knowledge from the class sessions on the 3rd and 5th of September. Don't panic if things don't make sense before then.
// Look through and understand the Driver. It will give you a feel for how your class will be utilized.
// Do not change the Driver. If it will not compile, check that your method names are the same as the assignment directs.
// Honors Component
// 
// There is no Honors component for this assignment.
// Submission
// 
// By Monday 08 September at 8:00 am, submit the file GroceryItem.java into your lab's appropriate D2L dropbox folder. DO NOT SUBMIT GroceryItem.class, just GroceryItem.java (one file)! GroceryItem.java can be found in the project folder (Outlab1) you created.
