{
// Inlab 4: A Baseball League
// 
// Due: Tuesday 23 September at 11:59 pm
// Purpose
// 
// Get more experience with programs involves interacting classes.
// Address type-casting issues.
// Partners
// 
// This is an individual assignment, though collaboration (not solution sharing) is allowed.
// 
// Problem Statement
// 
// You will build a program that represents baseball teams. To do this, you need two classes. The Player class will represent a baseball player and the Team class will represent a baseball team. A Player will consist of a name, the number of at bats they had (you are required to make this an integer), and the number of hits they had (again, must be an int). A Team will consist of three (exactly three) Players and a team name. You will then build methods that will calculate the batting average of the individual players and the overall team. NOTE: Batting Average = numHit / numAtBats.
// 
// Assignment
// 
// Create a project called Inlab4.
// Copy this code into a class called Driver (Don't modify it unless you are doing the Honors component). As discussed in class last week, you can gain a ton of information about the classes and methods you need to build from this code.
// Correctly implement the methods you need to get the Driver to compile and run. HINT: It may be easiest to have the printStats() method in the Team class (repeatedly) call a printStats() method in the Player class.
// If implemented correctly, your output will look like this.
// Honors Component
// 
// Create static variables in both the Team and Player class that will keep track of the number of instances of those classes created.
// Create three more Players and one more Team in the Driver.
// Modify the Driver so that it prints out the number of teams and players in the league before the team statistics. Your output should look like this.
// Submission
// 
// By Tuesday night at 11:59 pm, submit the files Player.java, Team.java, and Driver.java (if you modified it as part of the Honors Component) into the appropriate D2L dropbox folder. DO NOT SUBMIT .class files.
// 
// Grading - 10 points
// 
// 4 points (3 points for Honors Lab) - The new classes compile with the provided Driver.
// 2 points - The batting average for a player is correctly calculated, in the Player class, using type-casting.
// 2 points - The batting average for a team is correctly calculated, in the Team class, using type-casting.
// 1 points - The output looks like the output provided.
// 1 points - Good programming principles are followed (minimal unnecessary code, efficient solution,...).
// 0 points (1 point for Honors Lab) - The second output is replicated accurately using static variables and methods in the Team and Player classes.
